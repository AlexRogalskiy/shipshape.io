    <p>
      Brokermate is a financial technology platform that provides all the tools required to run a successful brokerage. Until
      now, brokers have had to rely on several different technologies to manage their business. Brokermate eliminates these
      layers and brings together everything you need in one solution.
    </p>

    <h4>Challenge</h4>

    <p>
      While developing a highly complex brokerage management and client interaction application, Brokermate discovered that
      new users needed a way to quickly get started using the service.
    </p>

    <h4>Solution</h4>

    <p>
      Integrating the Shepherd tour library, we were able to manage multiple visual guides for first time users to add
      required settings and communicate how the applications functioned. This was done in a way that lead new users to a home
      setup page, then tracked each tour state to ensure completion.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      We leveraged the existing library and customized many steps to accommodate design connections for the purpose
      of alerting the user of those steps with the location in the app they are currently located. We also had to add step tracking
      throughout the app to ensure that users had to complete certain steps, such as changing pages or adding account settings, before
      transitioning through tour steps.

    <p>
      Finally, we needed the tours to integrate into application features such as translations and transition animations
      so that they felt like an integrated part of the application as apposed to an add-on.

    <div>
      <h4>Outcome</h4>

      <p>
        New users are now shown a list of tours to help add required configurations and quickly get them familiar with the
        application. The user is scoped to either completing the action asked in the step
        or canceling a tour in order to return later.

      <p>
        They begin tours with customized themes for the tours to integrate naturally into the
        application flow. All features for this global application were applied to the tour
        initialization allowing for international, routable, and trackable tours.
