            At Ship Shape, contributing to open source software is an addiction. We maintain
            several Ember addons of our own, and have contributed to countless other
            projects throughout the open source community.

          Ember could not be the incredible framework it is, without companies helping fund
          its progress. Whether you need an Ember addon to implement your favorite
          library in native Ember, a custom Ember data adapter for your API setup,
          or changes to Ember itself, sponsored open source development can help
          give back to the community, while also solving your business needs.
