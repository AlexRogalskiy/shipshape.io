            We use the latest versions of Ember.js and Ember-CLI in all of our products, and
            we strive to stay up to date with new releases. We leverage the amazing Ember
            community, and the huge breadth of addons, to help us iterate faster, and
            focus on making quality apps, rather than reinventing the wheel.

            We'll keep you in the loop with regular demos, frequent calls, chats, dinners, drinks,
            whatever floats your boat. We won't just develop huge chunks of the app and
            hope you like it. Your input is crucial to making sure you are 100% happy
            with the product.
